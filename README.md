# Grade-Calculator
This is a VERY rudimentary grade calculator with *uplifting* messages dependent on your grade.
Of course the top is our variables, more sections can be added if necessary.
Second section defines the percentage that section is valued. All decimals should add up to "1" to achieve 100% grade.
  If your grade includes extra credit, the maximum value can exceed 1.0.
If new letters are added (you have more than six sections) add the letter value of the section to the my_list section
Grade is the total of all of the sections (Defined by letter) added together.
Numerical grade is then printed.
To add an uplifting message, edit the print values on the last 5 sections. Grades at my instituion are 10 points per grade.
